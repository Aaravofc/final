          There are 4 Technologies NASA is Advancing to Send Humans to Mars
        </h3>
        <p>
          Mars is an obvious source of inspiration for science fiction stories.
          It is familiar and well-studied, yet different and far enough away to
          compel otherworldly adventures. NASA has its sights on the Red Planet
          for many of the same reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robots, including the Perseverance rover launching soon to Mars, teach
          us about what it’s like on the surface. That intel helps inform future
          human missions to the Red Planet. We’ll also need to outfit spacecraft
          and astronauts with technologies to get them there, explore the
          surface, and safely return them home. The roundtrip mission, including
          time in transit – from and back to Earth – and on the Martian surface,
          will take about two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology development has already begun to enable a crewed Mars
          mission as early as the 2030s. Many of the capabilities will be
          demonstrated at the Moon first, during the Artemis missions, while
          other systems are more uniquely suited for deeper space. Here are six
          technologies NASA is working on to make Mars science fiction a
          reality.

            <h3>1. Powerful propulsion systems to get us there quicker</h3>
            <p>
              Astronauts bound for Mars will travel about 140 million miles into
              deep space. Advancements in propulsion capabilities are the key to
              reaching our destination as quickly and safely as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is too soon to say which propulsion system will take astronauts
              to Mars, but we know it needs to be nuclear-enabled to reduce
              travel time. NASA is advancing multiple options, including nuclear
              electric and nuclear thermal propulsion. Both use nuclear fission
              but are very different from each other. A nuclear electric rocket
              is more efficient, but it doesn’t generate a lot of thrust.
              Nuclear thermal propulsion, on the other hand, provides much more
              “oomph.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Whichever system is selected, the fundamentals of nuclear
              propulsion will reduce the crew’s time away from Earth. The agency
              and its partners are developing, testing, and maturing critical
              components of various propulsion technologies to reduce the risk
              of the first human mission to Mars.

              2. Inflatable heat shield to land astronauts on other planets
            </h3>
            <p>
              The largest rover we’ve landed on Mars is about the size of a car,
              and sending humans to Mars will require a much bigger spacecraft.
              New technologies will allow heavier spacecraft to enter the
              Martian atmosphere, approach the surface, and land close to where
              astronauts want to explore.
            </p>
            <p>
              NASA is working on an inflatable heat shield that allows the large
              surface area to take up less space in a rocket than a rigid one.
              The technology could land spacecraft on any planet with an
              atmosphere. It would expand and inflate before it enters the
              Martian atmosphere to land cargo and astronauts safely.
            </p>
            <p>
              The technology isn’t ready for the Red Planet just yet. An
              upcoming flight test of a 6-meter diameter (about 20-feet)
              prototype will demonstrate how the aeroshell performs as it enters
              Earth’s atmosphere. The test will prove it can survive the intense
              heat during entry at Mars.

            <h3>3. High-tech Martian spacesuits</h3>
            <p>
              Spacesuits are essentially custom spacecraft for astronauts.
              NASA’s latest spacesuit is so high-tech, its modular design is
              engineered to be evolved for use anywhere in space.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first woman and the next man on the Moon will wear NASA’s
              next-generation spacesuits called the exploration extravehicular
              mobility unit or xEMU. The spacesuits prioritize crew safety while
              also allowing Artemis Generation moonwalkers to make more natural,
              Earth-like movements and accomplish tasks that weren’t possible
              during the Apollo missions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Future upgrades to address the differences on Mars may include
              technology for life support functionality in the carbon
              dioxide-rich atmosphere and modified outer garments to keep
              astronauts warm during the Martian winter and prevent overheating
              in the summer season.

            <h3>4. Martian home and lab on wheels</h3>

            <p>
              To reduce the number of items needed to land on the surface, NASA
              will combine the first Martian home and vehicle into a single
              rover complete with breathable air.
            </p>
            <p>
              NASA has conducted extensive rover testing on Earth to inform
              development of a pressurized mobile home on the Moon. Artemis
              astronauts who live and work in the future pressurized Moon rover
              will be able to offer feedback to help refine the rover
              capabilities for astronauts on Mars. NASA’s robotic rovers will
              help with the Martian design, too – everything from the best
              wheels for Mars to how a larger vehicle will navigate the tough
              terrain.
            </p>
            Much like an RV, the pressurized rover will have everything inside
            that astronauts need to live and work for weeks. They can drive in
            comfortable clothing, tens of miles from the spacecraft that will
            launch them back to space for the return trip to Earth. When they
            encounter interesting locations, astronauts can put on their
            high-tech spacesuits to exit the rover and collect samples and
            conduct science experiments.

		<p> When the solar system was young, some scientists suspect it was too wild and raucous a place for life to develop. Earth, Mars, and the other planets were all being pelted by massive asteroids and rocky debris. Some of those rocks might have delivered the very water that later made life possible. But the unrelenting impacts may have made the surface too violent to sustain life.</p>
<p>  Exactly when that period of heavy impacts stopped remains a topic of debate among astronomy’s solar system historians. But new results from martian meteorites indicate that Mars had grown quiet by about 4.2 billion years ago, or about a half billion years before the first signs of life emerged on Earth. That might mean that Mars had enough time to develop life before it dried out in later years</p>
		<p> On August 7, 1996, reporters, photographers and television camera operators surged into NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. The crowd focused not on the row of seated scientists in NASA’s auditorium but on a small, clear plastic box on the table in front of them. Inside the box was a velvet pillow, and nestled on it like a crown jewel was a rock—from Mars. The scientists announced that they’d found signs of life inside the meteorite. NASA administrator Daniel Goldin gleefully said it was an “unbelievable” day. He was more accurate than he knew.  </p> 
		<p>The rock, the researchers explained, had formed 4.5 billion years ago on Mars, where it remained until 16 million years ago, when it was launched into space, probably by the impact of an asteroid. The rock wandered the inner solar system until 13,000 years ago, when it fell to Antarctica. It sat on the ice near AllanHills until 1984, when snowmobiling geologists scooped it up.</p>
	<p> Researchers used meteorites for their study. They can never know for certain, since the meteorites were recovered in Earth’s Saharan desert, but by comparing them to what else we know of Mars, these particular rocks are thought to come from Mars’ southern highlands. The region is thought to hold some of Mars’ oldest crust samples. And these meteorites contain minerals called zircons, which are treasured by geologists as being a reliable way to measure the age and history of incredibly old rocks, back to billions of years. </p>
	<p>While some devised ways of sending signals to Martian aliens, in 1899, Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla announced that he may have received a signal from Mars. The signal was in the form of cosmic radio waves picked up by his instruments, although later research would reveal they were radio waves emitted by interstellar gas clouds.</p>
	<p>Fascination with Martian life did not totally fade, however, and in 1996 a meteorite stirred up hopes, once again, that life may have existed on the red planet. A study in Science suggested that meteorite ALH84001 contained possible traces of primitive Martian bacteria. While some contested that the microfossils had been formed in the rock during the meteorite’s time on Earth, the finding nonetheless reinvigorated the hunt for signs of ancient Martian life.</p>
	<p>Since life—as we knows it—requires water, NASA engineers devised a new series of missions to follow the water. That led to the 1997 Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and the Pathfinder rover, followed by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers.</p>
    <p>In 2013, the Mars Curiosity rover landed in an ancient lakebed. Drilling into rocks and sedimentary layers since then, Curiosity has found that this spot once hosted calm fluid waters with a gentle chemistry that might have supported life.

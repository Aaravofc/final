        The possibility of life on Mars is a subject of interest in astrobiology
        due to the planet's proximity and similarities to Earth. To date, no
        proof of past or present life has been found on Mars. Cumulative
        evidence suggests that during the ancient Noachian time period, the
        surface environment of Mars had liquid water and may have been habitable
        for microorganisms, but habitable conditions do not necessarily indicate
        life.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        Mars is of particular interest for the study of the origins of life
        because of its similarity to the early Earth. This is especially true
        since Mars has a cold climate and lacks plate tectonics or continental
        drift, so it has remained almost unchanged since the end of the
        Hesperian period. At least two-thirds of Mars's surface is more than 3.5
        billion years old, and it could have been habitable since 4.48 billions
        of years ago, 500 million years before the earliest known Earth
        lifeforms.
        <br />
        Mars may thus hold the best record of the prebiotic conditions leading
        to life, even if life does not or has never existed there.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        As of 2018, there are 224 known Martian meteorites (some of which were
        found in several fragments). These are valuable because they are the
        only physical samples of Mars available to Earth-bound laboratories.
        Some researchers have argued that microscopic morphological features
        found in ALH84001 are biomorphs, however this interpretation has been
        highly controversial and is not supported by the majority of researchers
        in the field.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        Seven criteria have been established for the recognition of past life
        within terrestrial geologic samples. Those criteria are:
      </p>

      <ol style="margin-left: 10px">
        <li>
          Is the geologic context of the sample compatible with past life?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is the age of the sample and its stratigraphic location compatible
          with possible life?
        </li>
        <li>
          Does the sample contain evidence of cellular morphology and colonies?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is there any evidence of biominerals showing chemical or mineral
          disequilibria?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is there any evidence of stable isotope patterns unique to biology?
        </li>
        <li>Are there any organic biomarkers present?</li>
        <li>Are the features indigenous to the sample?</li>
      </ol>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        Mars had a wet past, where liquid water clearly flowed on the surface
        for more than a billion years. Circumstantial evidence has pointed to
        the plausibility of life on Mars, not only in the ancient past, but
        possibly still living, and perhaps occasionally active, even today.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        Mars had early life, and it still persists in a mostly-dormant form
        beneath the surface. This is the most optimistic, but still
        scientifically viable, view of life on Mars. Perhaps life took hold
        early on, and when Mars lost its atmosphere, a few extremophiles
        remained in a sort of frozen, suspended-animation state. When the right
        conditions emerged — perhaps underground, where liquid water can
        occasionally flow — that life “wakes up” and begins performing its
        critical biological functions.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        If this is the case, then there are still organisms to be found beneath
        the Martian surface, perhaps in the shallow sands just a few feet or
        even mere inches below our spacecraft. We’re likely only talking about
        single-celled life, perhaps not even reaching the complexity of a
        eukaryotic cell, but life on any world other than Earth would still be a
        revolution for science. NASA’s Perseverance rover, which launched
        successfully on July 30, 2020, will collect critical soil samples to
        attempt to test this hypothetical scenario
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        Currently, the surface of Mars is bathed with ionizing radiation, and
        Martian soil is rich in perchlorates toxic to microorganisms.[13][14]
        Therefore, the consensus is that if life exists—or existed—on Mars, it
        could be found or is best preserved in the subsurface, away from
        present-day harsh surface processes
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        There is a tremendous hope that current and future generations of Mars
        rovers and orbiters will help us finally puzzle out whether Mars —
        either now or at any point in its past — has ever harbored life. If the
        answer to that question is affirmative, then it leads to an important
        follow-up question: is that life related to or independent of life on
        Earth? It is possible that life originated on Earth and seeded Mars with
        life; it’s possible that life originated on Mars and then seeded Earth;
        it’s even possible that life predated both Earth and Mars, and early
        forms of it took hold on both planets.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        But at this point in time, we have no overwhelming evidence that life
        ever existed on Mars at all. We have a few hints that could be
        indicators of past or present life there, but entirely inorganic
        processes could explain each and every one of those observed results.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 10px">
        As always, the only way we’ll find out the truth is by conducting more
        and better science with superior instruments and techniques. As NASA’s
        Perseverance rover moves ahead to collect a variety of soil samples, the
        next step will be returning them to Earth for laboratory analysis. If we
        succeed at that, we could know for certain, within the next decade,
        which of these five possibilities is most consistent with the truth
        about Mars.
